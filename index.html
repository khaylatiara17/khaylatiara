            <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
            <p>
                You can call me Tiara, an Informatics Engineering student with a strong interest in learning new technologies and using them to solve real-world problems. With over 15 years of experience in Office Administration, I bring strong skills in managing data details, organizing information, and improving processes as I embark on this exciting journey in the tech world.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that technology is a powerful tool to create innovative and sustainable solutions for a better future. I am eager to keep learning and developing my skills in Data Science, as well as working on local technologies that can make a positive impact, especially in remote areas of Indonesia.
            </p>
            <p>
                This mini-site is a small step that reflects my dedication, curiosity, and drive to create meaningful work. I believe in lifelong learning and am always open to opportunities for collaboration, discussions, or feedback to grow and improve.
            </p>

            <h2>LIFE GOAL</h2>
            <p>
                My life goal is to keep growing as a person, contribute positively to society and create useful solutions through technology. I want to use my skills and experience to solve challenges, whether big or small and help build a better and more sustainable future.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also aim to live a balanced life, staying true to myself, valuing connections with others and appreciating every step of the journey with purpose and meaning.
            </p>

            <h2>SUPPORT SYSTEM</h2>
            <p>
                A support system is very important to me, as it provides an environment that helps me grow both personally and professionally. This support comes from my family, close friends and people around me who offer feedback, advice and confidence to keep me moving forward.
            </p>
            <p>
                Technology also plays a key role in my support system, making it easier for me to learn and communicate by putting my thoughts into writing, which I sometimes find hard to express on my own. With this support, I feel more prepared to face challenges, continue learning and achieve the goals I dream of.

        <!-- About Section -->
        <section id="about" class="section">
            <h1>PROFILE</h1>
            <p>
                Tiara is an Informatics Engineering student with a strong interest in new technologies. She is always eager to learn and improve. Born and raised in Jakarta, Tiara comes from a Sumatera Utara heritage with Batak ethnicity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tiara began her studies at Universitas Dian Nusantara in September 2023 and has big dreams of continuing her education to pursue a master's degree. Her ultimate goal is to become an educator in Indonesia's remote areas, contributing to the education sector. Despite the challenges in her higher education journey, Tiara remains determined to complete her studies and hopes for ease in overcoming any difficulties along the way.
            </p>

            <h2>HOBBIES</h2>
            <p>
                Tiara enjoys outdoor activities, especially mountain hiking. It gives her the chance to explore nature, relieve stress and gain unforgettable experiences. Additionally, she enjoys reading books, articles, and watching videos on YouTube to broaden her knowledge from different perspectives. As a tech enthusiast, Tiara also loves exploring new things in the digital world and software development.
            </p>

            <h2>STRENGTHS</h2>
            <p>
                Tiara is known for her empathy and strong ideals. She values honesty, has strong principles and is independent, which makes her unique but sometimes less compatible with others. She is disciplined, responsible, and detail-oriented, which stands out in both her work and daily life. Tiara is dedicated and always strives to do her best in everything she works on.
            </p>

            <h2>WEAKNESS</h2>
            <p>
                Tiara sometimes faces challenges in verbal communication, especially when expressing her opinions. This means she occasionally needs support from people who understand her to solve problems. She is also highly dependent on the quality of leadership around her. When guided by a good leader, she can perform her tasks to the best of her ability; however, the opposite can also be true. Tiara tends to be more comfortable in solitude, as she feels happier being alone than in an environment that doesn't support her.
